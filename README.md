# 🏀 NCAA Basketball Assistant

NCAA Basketball Assistant is a powerful, end-to-end analytics and recommendation system built with Streamlit, Groq LLM, and Pinecone, designed specifically for NCAA basketball programs. The tool helps coaches, analysts, and recruiters make data-driven decisions by enabling:
	•	AI-powered Q&A on team summaries (e.g., “How did Purdue perform in 2023?”),
	•	Smart recruiting recommendations based on player similarity,
	•	Context-aware responses using embedded scouting reports and historical data.

Users can interact with a conversational assistant that retrieves and summarizes relevant scouting information, run a recruit similarity search to find look-alike prospects, and explore team-level stats across multiple seasons.

Behind the scenes, it combines:
	•	🔍 Semantic search using Sentence-BERT
	•	💬 Generative answers from Groq-hosted LLaMA
	•	🧠 Vector storage & retrieval from Pinecone
	•	📊 Streamlit for an interactive, multi-tabbed frontend interface

This is not just a chatbot — it’s a modular basketball intelligence suite, helping teams scout smarter and recruit better.
